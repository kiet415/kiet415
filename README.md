### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**kiet415/kiet415** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

My name is Kiet Nguyen and I'm a software engineer who majored in Computer Science at University of California Santa Cruz, and
pursued for additional education at App Academy to develop skills and learn more about modern technology that company uses.

At App Academy, I spent around 80-100 hours a week  furthering my skills and knowledge in React, Redux, Ruby on Rails, Javascript, MongoDB, and SQL.

In two weeks, I created a single page full stack web app where I used React and Rails to build a clone of Yelp to create a personalized experience for each user.
I also worked alongside two other engineers to create another single page web app with React and MongoDB that allows users to click on food ingredients which calls to the Spoonacular API to display recipes that can be created with those ingredients.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my full stack project 
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can do a one-handed cartwheel!
